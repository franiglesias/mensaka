# Mensaka

Mensaka is a messaging system for PHP applications.

It was created as a way to learn about how command and event buses work, and to try several testing and  techniques.

There are some well known packages, such as simpleBus or Tactician, but I think that reinvent the wheel can be a great learning exercise.
